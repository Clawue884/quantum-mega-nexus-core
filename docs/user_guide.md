# User Guide for Quantum Mega Nexus

## Introduction
This user guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to utilize the Quantum Mega Nexus platform for quantum computing tasks. It covers job submission, monitoring, and retrieving results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies as outlined in the [README.md](../README.md).
- Familiarize yourself with the Quantum Mega Nexus architecture and API endpoints (see [architecture.md](architecture.md) and [API_reference.md](API_reference.md)).

### Setting Up Your Environment
1. Clone the Quantum Mega Nexus repository: `git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/quantum-mega-nexus-core.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd quantum-mega-nexus-core`
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` (on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`)

## Submitting a Job
1. Prepare your quantum code in a file (e.g., `quantum_code.py`).
2. Use the CLI tool to submit the job: `python src/cli/cli_tool.py submit --job-name "My Quantum Job" --quantum-code quantum_code.py`

## Monitoring Job Status
1. Use the CLI tool to retrieve the job status: `python src/cli/cli_tool.py status --job-id <job_id>`

## Retrieving Results
1. Once the job is completed, use the CLI tool to retrieve the results: `python src/cli/cli_tool.py results --job-id <job_id>`

## Troubleshooting
For common issues and solutions, refer to the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) section.

## Conclusion
The Quantum Mega Nexus platform is designed to simplify the process of leveraging quantum computing for complex problem-solving. This user guide provides a comprehensive overview of the steps involved in submitting, monitoring, and retrieving results from quantum jobs. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers.
